        are getting married!

      <p>
        We have decided to keep our wedding to parents and siblings only. While

      <h2>üéÅ Whether to gift</h2>
      <p>
        We're <em>not</em> expecting gifts ‚ù§Ô∏è. That said, should you decide to
        contribute to the start of our lives we have a few options available.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'd very much appreciate a cash gift towards furnishings in our new
        home. We don't quite know what we're going to need yet, so a cash gift
        will go a long way!
