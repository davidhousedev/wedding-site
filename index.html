        We have an accepted offer on our forever-home in Roylston. We're so
        excited! As many of you know, buying a house is expensive and we would
        love some help starting off on the right foot with furniture and
        equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps you want to give a gift, but you'd prefer to give us something
        tangible. We have a wedding registry open with Crate and Barrel. Please
        let us know if you'd like a link ‚ù§Ô∏è.
